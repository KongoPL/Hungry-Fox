This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Project created to learn React, and how it works. It's simple restaurant page, made without CSS frameworks. However I made my own, small framework that have grids, buttons, helpers etc. etc.

During this project I learned a lot about React and I gained sort-of fluency in using it.
